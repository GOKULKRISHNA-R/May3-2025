# 🌊 Riding the AI Wave: Let’s Surf Together!

Welcome to the companion repo for the workshop **"Riding the AI Wave: Let’s Surf Together!"** – a session hosted to help 2nd-year graduate students dive into the world of **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, and **AI-assisted development**.

---

## 🚀 Workshop Summary

In this workshop, we explored:

- The evolution of the **AI wave** – from `.com`, mobile, and SaaS waves to the current **monstrous AI wave**
- The fundamentals of **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity
- Real-world impact of AI releases on the tech economy
- Key AI concepts like:
  - 🔁 Auto-regression
  - 🧩 Tokens
  - 💭 Hallucinations
  - 🧠 ReAct & RAG
  - 🤖 AI Agents & Workflows

## 🛠 Hands-On: Build Your AI-Powered Portfolio

As a practical takeaway, participants built a **personal portfolio website** using:

| Tool         | Purpose                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 💡 Perplexity AI | Analyze UI/UX from real websites           |
| ✍️ ChatGPT       | Generate prompts using resume + analysis   |
| 💻 Cursor IDE    | Use AI-powered dev environment to code     |

In **under 1 hour**, we created working, custom portfolios using AI — with no manual coding or Figma needed!

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

You can replicate the same in 3 steps:

1. **Pick a reference website** – analyze it with [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
2. **Feed your resume + UI analysis to ChatGPT** – ask it to generate a Cursor prompt
3. **Paste the prompt in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/)** – let AI build your portfolio!

## 🌐 Evolution of Tech Waves

- **2000 – .com Wave**  
  Google, eBay, etc. → .com crash  
- **Mobile Wave**  
  Apple pioneered the smartphone era  
- **Social Media Wave**  
  Meta, Twitter  
- **2021 – SaaS Wave**  
  Freshworks became the **first Indian SaaS company listed on Nasdaq (Sep 22, 2021)**  
  Chennai: **SaaS Capital of India**  
- **Monstrous AI Wave**  
  - DeepSeek model release → Nasdaq fell **3.1%**  
  - Nvidia lost **$500B**, Google **$100B**  
  - All because of **just one model**!  
  - 🔁 **SAIL: Be a Pioneer**

---

## 🧰 Core AI Concepts

- Google Translate: ML model without deep context
- **Tokens** = Chunks of breakable data
- **GPT** = Generative Pretrained Transformer  
  - Decoder-only model  
  - Auto-regressive (predicts next token)  
- **ChatGPT** = Text input + GPT model  
- Large model space → Predicts until "End of Sequence"

## 📣 Quote

> A tech that can be easily understood by a **Tamil mom** is a scalable tech 💥

## 🧠 Prompting Techniques

- **Chain of Thought** → Break into smaller prompts
- **ReAct** = Reason + Act
- Prompt Types:
  - 🔹 Zero-shot
  - 🔸 Few-shot
  - 🧩 Chain-of-Thought
  - ⚙️ ReAct

---

## 🛠 AI Tools Used to Build Portfolio

- **Perplexity** – Extracted data from LinkedIn/profile sites  
- **ChatGPT** – Converted resume + analysis into a Cursor prompt  
- **Cursor IDE** – Used prompt to build the portfolio  

> ✅ Portfolio built in under an hour using 4–5 AI tools!

## 🏆 How to Stand Out in the AI Era

- Don’t become lazy with AI  
- Use saved time to:
  - Research how it actually works  
  - Learn decision-making logic behind AI outputs  
- **Post-AI Interviews:**  
  - Conversion rates dropped **100%**  
  - Candidates must show **judgment, reasoning**

---

## 🗃 Example: Table Joins Optimization

- AI suggests many options:  
  - Indexes, keys, views, partitions, shards  
- But **who chooses the best one?**
  - ➤ You do. **Right decision-makers win**

---

## 💬 Developer Questions

- **Can AI overtake devs?**  
  Until AI becomes **self-reviewing**, unlikely  
- **Devin AI** – Who’s going to own it?

---

## 🧩 Agentic Protocols

- **MCP** – Model Context Protocol  
  - Makes AI aware of current state  
  - Expensive: 1 query → 3 API calls  
  - Data-heavy: delete item? → might run out of tokens

---

## 🔢 How AI Thinks: Numbers!

- All ML models work on **numeric space**  
- Text → Vectors (word2vec)  
- Similar concepts are **close** in vector space  
  - Example: *cat* and *dog* are numerically near
